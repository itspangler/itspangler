<!-- My writing explores the complicated relationships between people and the places they inhabit. I'm working on a long essay—which has threatened to mutate, on more than one occasion, into a short book—about Tullah Hanley, an Egyptian-Hungarian exotic dancer who moved to the United States in the 1940s, married an Pennsylvanian oil tycoon, and became a *force majeure* in the world of modern art and literature. I am happy to tell you more about Tullah, especially if you'd like to pay me to write the rest of her story. -->
